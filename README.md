**`pokeemerald-expansion`** is a GBA ROM hack base that equips developers with a comprehensive toolkit for creating Pokémon ROM hacks. **`pokeemerald-expansion`** is built on top of [pret's `pokeemerald`](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald) decompilation project. **It is not a playable Pokémon game on its own.** 

# [Features](FEATURES.md)

**`pokeemerald-expansion`** offers hundreds of features from various [core series Pokémon games](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Core_series), along with popular quality-of-life enhancements designed to streamline development and improve the player experience. A full list of those features can be found in [`FEATURES.md`](FEATURES.md).

# Choosing `pokeemerald` or **`pokeemerald-expansion`**

- **`pokeemerald-expansion`** supports multiplayer functionality with other games built on **`pokeemerald-expansion`**. It is not compatible with official Pokémon games.
- If compatibility with official games is important, use [`pokeemerald`](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald). Otherwise, we recommend using **`pokeemerald-expansion`**.
- **`pokeemerald-expansion`** incorporates regular updates from `pokeemerald`, including bug fixes and documentation improvements.
