# Pokemon Emerald Imperium
Emerald Imperium is a highly modified ROM hack of Pokémon Emerald, focusing on strategic battles, trainer difficulty scaling, team variety, and Nuzlocke challenge support. Every route has been rebalanced, every trainer reimagined, and the Pokédex has been revamped from top to bottom, including brand new Mega forms for beloved Pokémon such as the Sinnoh starters, Luxray, and more.

This hack aims to provide a fresh and challenging experience similar to what is offered by Radical Red, including balance and type changes, competitive battles, and increased difficulty, but located in the beloved Hoenn region.

Whether you're a seasoned player looking for a new challenge or a newcomer wanting to experience Hoenn in a different light, Emerald Imperium offers a unique adventure with new features, mechanics, and an engaging storyline.
